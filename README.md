## Philosophy

Some students go to school because they need the degree to get a job.  These students optimize their actions to get the best grades for the least amount of work.

The best students go to school to learn, and while they often try to get good grades, they optimize their actions so as to learn as much as they can.

Likewise, some companies follow regulations to get certified to sell their products.  They optimize everything they do to get past the regulators for the lowest cost.

The best companies follow the regulations with a degree of faith that these regulations will make their products better and safer.
