# Frequently Asked Questions

## Customization

*We have a separate Risk Management Plan. Can we use RDM?*

Yes! We recommend replacing the content of the risk related activities in the Software Plan with references to the Risk Management plan. Then search through the references of the word "risk" in the Software Plan and update as necessary (we suspect few changes will be necessary). We have used this approach on Innolitics' client projects. You will also want to update the `risk_matrix_location` in `system.yml`.
