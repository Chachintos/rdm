# CAPA Inputs

What was the inciting event(s) that lead to the creation of this CAPA?

# CAPA Effectiveness Measurement

Identify some metrics to track the effectiveness of the CAPA. For example, if an increase in customer complaints per week lead to the creation of the CAPA, tracking the same metric is an effective measurement strategy.

The level of measurement burden shall be related to the risk or harm imposed by this CAPA. A CAPA correcting for a patient death, for example, shall have more oversight than a CAPA correcting for an error in a regulatory submission.
